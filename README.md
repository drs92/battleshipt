# BattleShipt!

Welcome to Battleshipt. The rules of the game are simple- you place your ships, and then you and the other player take turns alternating attacking each other.

You can choose the orientation of your ship, as well as its size (3-5). The size of a ship indicates how many hits will sink the ship.
